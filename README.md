# Pierre Store

#### By _**Brit Wallace**_

#### _An application for ._

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET 5.0
* dotnet
* MySql/Workbench

## Description

An application for Pierre's Bakery to track savory and sweet treats. The application is capable of the following:
* The application will have user authentication.
* The user can log in and log out.
* Only logged in users should have create, update and delete functionality.
* There should be a many-to-many relationship between Treats and Flavors. A treat can have many flavors (such as sweet, savory, spicy, or creamy) and a flavor can have many treats. For instance, the "sweet" flavor could include chocolate croissants, cheesecake, and so on.
* A user should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all treats and flavors. Users should be able to click on an individual treat or flavor to see all the treats/flavors that belong to it.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Make sure you have MySql Workbench installed on your computer.
* Make sure to have dotnet-ef installed too.<br>
<em>This project uses <code>dotnet-ef --version 3.0.0</code> which I have globally installed but you can install it however you want. 
* Download repo to your computer using either clone or the download link.
* Open the project in VScode or your terminal/IDE of choice.
* Create a <code>appsettings.json</code> file in the root directory of the project folder. And add the following code replacing anything in square brackets with the information it represents specific to the project database:
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[DATABASE-NAME-HERE];uid=[USER-ID-HERE];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
  }
}

```

Example of complete appsettings.json:
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=to_do_list;uid=root;pwd=MySuperStrongPassword;"
  }
}

```
* Make sure to run your mysql server and open MySql workbench.
* Open MySql Workbench and login to your server.
* Click on the Administration tab in the Navigator on the left side of the screen. (this tab will likely be on the bottom of the window)
* In the management section of this administration tab click on the button called <code>Data Import/Export</code>. 
* Once the data import window opens click on <code>Import from Self-Contained file</code> radio button, navigate into the project folder and select <code>brit_wallace.sql</code> using the file path next to that radio button.
* Now click on the <code>New...</code> button in the section marked "Default Schema to be Imported To" directly underneath the import options section.
* Click on the "Import Progress" tab at the top of the Data import window.
* At the bottom of this tab click the button that reads <code>Start Import</code>.
* Confirm the database has been imported and you can check it by clicking the "Schemas" tab on the navigator at the left side of the program. Right click in the white space and select "Refresh All"
* Now using your IDE navigate into the Treats.Solutions/Pierre/ folder and use the command <code>dotnet run</code> to launch the program. 
* The site should be available at the server address you used in the <code>appsettings.json</code> folder.

### Test Setup/Installation

* Open the repo on your editor of choice/terminal
